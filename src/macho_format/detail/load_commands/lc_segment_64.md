# LC_SEGMENT_64

* `LC_SEGMENT_64`
	* 数据结构定义：`segment_command_64`
  * 含义：Defines a 64-bit segment of this file to be mapped into the address space of the process that loads this file. It also includes all the sections contained by the segment.

## segment_command_64定义

```c
/*
 * The 64-bit segment load command indicates that a part of this file is to be
 * mapped into a 64-bit task's address space.  If the 64-bit segment has
 * sections then section_64 structures directly follow the 64-bit segment
 * command and their size is reflected in cmdsize.
