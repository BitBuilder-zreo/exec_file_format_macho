# Load Commands

[源码定义](https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2050.18.24/EXTERNAL_HEADERS/mach-o/loader.h)：

```c
/*
 * The load commands directly follow the mach_header.  The total size of all
 * of the commands is given by the sizeofcmds field in the mach_header.  All
 * load commands must have as their first two fields cmd and cmdsize.  The cmd
 * field is filled in with a constant for that command type.  Each command type
 * has a structure specifically for it.  The cmdsize field is the size in bytes
 * of the particular load command structure plus anything that follows it that
 * is a part of the load command (i.e. section structures, strings, etc.).  To
 * advance to the next load command the cmdsize can be added to the offset or
 * pointer of the current load command.  The cmdsize for 32-bit architectures
 * MUST be a multiple of 4 bytes and for 64-bit architectures MUST be a multiple
 * of 8 bytes (these are forever the maximum alignment of any load commands).
 * The padded bytes must be zero.  All tables in the object file must also
 * follow these rules so the file can be memory mapped.  Otherwise the pointers
 * to these tables will not work well or at all on some machines.  With all
 * padding zeroed like objects will compare byte for byte.
 */
struct load_command {
	uint32_t cmd;		/* type of load command */
	uint32_t cmdsize;	/* total size of command in bytes */
};

/*
 * After MacOS X 10.1 when a new load command is added that is required to be
 * understood by the dynamic linker for the image to execute properly the
 * LC_REQ_DYLD bit will be or'ed into the load command constant.  If the dynamic
 * linker sees such a load command it it does not understand will issue a
 * "unknown load command required for execution" error and refuse to use the
 * image.  Other load commands without this bit that are not understood will
 * simply be ignored.
